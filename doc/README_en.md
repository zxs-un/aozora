AOZORA is an acronym for "Allgemeine Ordentliche SOgenannte RechnenAnlage",
which means "general-purpose well-organized so-called computing machinery".
AOZORA may also be transcribed 
as Japanese Romaji to Kanji (漢字, Chinese characters) "青空".

The AOZORA project aims to implement a 16-bit computer
with mainly 7400-series IC on breadboards,
providing an open and easy platform for educational purposes.
